This repository features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze global furniture sales data for the years 2021-22. The dashboard offers an in-depth look at key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, and influential factors affecting sales, providing valuable insights for business decision-making and strategic planning.

## Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to provide a detailed overview of global furniture sales, allowing stakeholders to understand key trends and metrics that drive business success. By analyzing top segments and identifying key influencers, businesses can optimize their sales strategies, improve forecasting, and increase profitability.


## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Gokuashh/Data-Analysis-Powerbi/blob/main/Global%20furniture%20input.xlsx">Global Furniture Sales Data</a>

## Key Features:
- **Top Segments Analysis:** 
  - We identified the top-selling product segments and analyzed the trends in which the number of items sold is more likely to be high. This analysis helps determine peak sales periods and enables better forecasting for inventory and marketing strategies.
  
- **Key Influencers Analysis:** 
  - Through the use of Power BI's "Key Influencers" feature, we analyzed the factors that most significantly influence the number of items sold. By identifying these key influencers, businesses can focus on areas such as pricing, promotions, or product features to optimize sales.

- **Comprehensive Metrics:**
  - **Sum of Number of Items Sold:** Total quantity of items sold globally across regions and product categories.
  - **Sum of Revenue and Item Cost:** Financial performance, including the total revenue generated and the total cost of items sold.
  - **Salesperson Count by Region/Product:** Insights into the number of salespeople working in each region and on each product, allowing for better resource allocation and sales performance tracking.
  - **Customer Purchase Patterns:** Count of the number of items sold per customer, identifying customer buying behaviors and trends.
  - **Regional Performance:** Sum of items sold and margin by region, helping to identify strong markets and areas for growth.
  - **Yearly and Monthly Margin Analysis:** Sum of the margin by year and month, offering a clear view of profitability trends over time.
  - **Additional KPIs:** Metrics such as average sales per region, product category performance, and more.

## Process:
1. **Data Transformation and Import:**
   - The data was initially stored in Excel and transformed into structured Power BI data tables. The dataset included information about sales, regions, product categories, customers, and salespeople.
  
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Extensive data cleaning was done to remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies, and handle missing or erroneous values. This step ensured that the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis.

3. **Data Modeling:**
   - The data was organized into appropriate tables and relationships, allowing for smooth interactions across different reports. Key relationships between sales, products, customers, and regions were established to enable dynamic reporting.

4. **Interactive Visualizations:**
   - Power BI was used to create a range of dynamic visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and KPI indicators. These visualizations were designed to help users easily explore the data, identify trends, and drill down into specific metrics or regions.

5. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - The final Power BI dashboard was designed with a user-friendly interface, enabling users to interact with the data through filters, slicers, and drill-down features. This interactivity allows users to view detailed insights on specific segments, regions, or time periods.

## Technologies Used:
- **Power BI:** For creating the interactive dashboard and reports.
- **Excel:** For initial data preparation and transformation.
- **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX):** Used to create calculated columns and measures for advanced metrics like total revenue, margin, and sales performance.
- **Power Query:** Used for data transformation, cleaning, and shaping the raw data into a usable format for analysis.

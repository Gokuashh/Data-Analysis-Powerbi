# Sales Insights Power BI Dashboard

This project involves building a Power BI dashboard to gain valuable insights from a sales dataset. The data was sourced from an SQL database, which was then exported into Excel and CSV files for further processing. Using Power BI, I performed several data transformation and cleaning tasks to extract meaningful insights, such as revenue analysis by market, sales quantities, and identifying top customers and products.

## Project Overview

### Data Source
- SQL Database: The primary data source for this project was an SQL database containing sales-related data.
- Exported Data: Data was exported to Excel and CSV formats to facilitate further analysis and processing in Power BI.

### Data Processing
1. Data Extraction: I extracted the sales data from the SQL database and exported it into Excel and CSV files.
2. Data Cleaning: Performed necessary data cleaning tasks to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct data inconsistencies.
3. Data Transformation: Applied transformations in Power BI to create the required metrics and fields, such as:
   - Revenue based on market data.
   - Sales quantity analysis.
   - Calculation of top 5 customers and products.

### Key Insights
The Power BI dashboard presents several key insights, including:
- Revenue by Market: Visualized revenue generated in different markets to analyze performance.
- Sales Quantity: Examined the sales quantities of products across different regions.
- Top 5 Customers: Identified the top 5 customers based on sales volume.
- Top 5 Products: Found the best-selling products based on revenue and quantity.

## Technologies Used
- SQL: For querying and extracting data from the database.
- Excel/CSV: For data export and intermediate storage.
- Power BI: For data analysis, transformation, and dashboard creation.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Extract Data: Query the SQL database to extract the required sales data.
2. Export Data: Export the data into Excel or CSV format.
3. Data Cleaning: Clean and transform the data to remove duplicates and handle missing values in PowerBI.
4. Create Visualizations:
   - Build charts to display revenue by market.
   - Create a table to show the top 5 customers and products.
   - Implement slicers for filtering the data by different categories (e.g., market, product).
5. Publish and Share: Publish the Power BI report and share the insights with stakeholders.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time data updates to keep the dashboard current.
- Add more advanced analytics, such as predictive models for sales forecasting.
- Incorporate additional data sources for more comprehensive analysis (e.g., customer demographic data)
